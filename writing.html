      description: "As a person interested in thinking about both Philosophy and Computer Science, AI is at the intersection of that, which means that I do tend to think about it a lot. I am not interested in AI from a technical standpoint, but more from a philosophical lens."

      description: "I am by no means a professional philosopher, but I try my best to formalize my arguments and present them in an easily digestible way. I hope at the very least my writing makes you think a little bit more about the topic."

                I have a ranging array of interests, so I wanted to have a space to be able to write about them and share it. If you ever notice any typos, please email me (<a href="mailto:hi@reesdraminski.com">hi@reesdraminski.com</a>) so that I can get them fixed, and I also am always open to having a conversation about any of my articles.
