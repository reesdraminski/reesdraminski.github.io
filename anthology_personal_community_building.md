WORK IN PROGRESS! So don't judge too heavily.

## Introduction

I believe that a strong community with a sense of belonging and a sense of being seen/known is the key to a good life and happiness. I believe that with the erosion of various social structures (like religion), there are less pre-formed communities for people to plug into/join. I believe that this is unfortunate, but it gives us the opportunity to take it into our own hands and gather people that we love the most into a community of our own. I call this personal community building and it is a little bit different than traditional community.

## Part I: Friendship

I believe that personal community building happens through friendship. You cultivate friendship with individuals but this can be done in a one-on-one or group setting.

### How to Cultivate Friendship

* how to find and make friends
    * shared interests/doing an activity together
        * sports
        * reading/watching groups
    * how to create spaces for mixing friend groups
        * hosting!
* how to keep friends
* how to deepen relationships
    * intention or repeated exposure

### Why Center Friendship?

* all relationships should be about friendship, even romantic ones
* why is friendship important?
    * loneliness = bad
    * feeling understood and seen = good
* you should center friendships of all types
    * [I argue against the idea of "best friends"]({% post_url 2023-11-27-Developing-A-Non-Hierarchical-View-of-Friendships %}).

### How to Center Friendship

* make time for friends
* make sure romantic partners integrate with your friends
* have keeping and making friends as a top priority (doesn’t have to be #1 tho)

## Part II: Community

### How to Create Community

* allow people to help others
