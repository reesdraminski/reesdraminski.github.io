                    I currently serve as the Director of Technology for <a href="https://tecanal.org">TeCanal</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to providing STEM education and technology resources to underserved communities. I develop curriculum and technological tools to teach Computer Science in underresourced schools, most of the time with limited Internet connections.

                    In the past, I was a part of the Inaugural <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/council-for-digital-good/">Microsoft Council for Digital Good</a> which was comprised of 15 students from around the U.S. We met around and discussed digital civility, social media, privacy, and other Internet-related topics. With this organization, I was able to speak at a UNICEF-Microsoft joint hosted panel called <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/empowering-children-digital-age/33545">Empowering Children in a Digital Age</a>.
