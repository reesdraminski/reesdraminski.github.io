                I most recently served as the Director of Technology for <a href="https://tecanal.org">TeCanal</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to providing STEM education and technology resources to underserved communities. I was previously the CTO (2017) and CEO (2018) of this organization, before becoming the Director of Technology until 2021, when the organization dissolved. In these roles, I spent my time developing curriculum and technological tools to teach Computer Science in underresourced schools, most of the time with limited Internet connections. As a result of my work with TeCanal, I was awarded the <a href="https://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/ravens-name-2017-community-quarterback-award-winners-19900484">Baltimore Ravens Community Quarterback Award</a> in 2017 and the <a href="https://www.pointsoflight.org/awards/teen-brings-passion-for-stem-to-the-masses-tutoring-underserved-students/">Daily Point of Light Award</a> in 2018.

                In the past, I was a part of the Inaugural <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/council-for-digital-good/">Microsoft Council for Digital Good</a> which was comprised of 15 students from around the U.S. We met around and discussed digital civility, social media, privacy, and other Internet-related topics. With this organization, I was able to speak at a UNICEF-Microsoft joint hosted panel called <a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/empowering-children-digital-age/33545">Empowering Children in a Digital Age</a>. When Microsoft published their 5th annual Digital Civility Index Report for 2020, I was <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/thanks-to-teenagers-we-were-nice-to-each-other-online-in-2020-per-microsoft-data">interviewed</a> about my experience with the Council, as well my thoughts about why Digital Civility increased so much as a result of youth activity.
