I created something called "Syntax Tutor" to challenge students to critically think about syntax, but also create good debugging pattern recognition habits It is not so much matching definitions to symbols, but rather showing the student correct and incorrect examples of code syntax. They would then have to choose if this is an example or correct or incorrect syntax. Ideally the program would be able to identify what kind of mistakes the student makes, and adapts to show them more examples of it so they can learn it faster and stronger. There would be a list of different syntax rules that the student wouldnâ€™t have to learn. A non-exhaustive list would be: terminating semi-colons, matching curly braces, matching quotation marks. The students would have to identify them as using good coding practices or state the syntax mistake. This will teach the students recognition, a useful skill that will allow them to read their own code with a critical eye so they know how to find their own mistakes.
