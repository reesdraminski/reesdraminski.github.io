This list is purely based off of how the beers appeal to me. My ranking system as described [in my article about logging beers on Untappd](https://reesdraminski.com/writing/beer-ratings#how-does-untappd-reviewing-work-how-do-i-approach-rating) is mostly about personal enjoyment, but that a beer may experience a rating bump if I recognize that it’s not a quality thing, but a personal taste thing. In no way am I insinuating that breweries are bad if they do not make beers that suit my tastes.
