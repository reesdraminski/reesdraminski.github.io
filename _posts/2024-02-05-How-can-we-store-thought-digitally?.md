a related idea is Digital Gardening and Digital Second Brains (PKMS)
* a lot of my thinking in inspired by these two phenomena/movements
* digital gardening
    * https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history 

these knowledge management systems are about knowledge: information and opinions	
* in a way its to provide value externally via knowledge work
    * giving people insights or connections of information (learning in public)
    * helps you recombine ideas for new projects and thinking

how can you dump context onto a page for further processing later? 
* the more you can empty from your brain now means more processing power available for thinking of other stuff if your executive function allows you to table things
* the better you can situate your thoughts in context the less is lost when you pick back processing the train of thought later which minimizes the cost of the context switch and possibility of loss of potential thoughts from the first brainstorming session to the second one 
    * does the ability to reconstruct thought processes vary from person to person? is it a learnable skill?
