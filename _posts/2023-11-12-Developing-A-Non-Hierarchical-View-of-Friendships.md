## Why non-hierarchical?
[Relationship anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_anarchy) is the idea of questioning and breaking down the hierarchy of relationships within our life whether that be familial, platonic, or romantic. In this article I will focus primarily on providing a framework to think about friendships in a non-hierarchical manner. However, I think this framework could be adapted to fit other types of relationships as well with a bit of effort and extra thinking. 

I wanted to first focus on friendship because I think that we unconsciously rank them because we have this grand notion of a “best friend”. You have your normal, regular friends, but then you have your “best friend”, who would do anything for you, and you would do anything for them. Some people only believe in having a single best friend, while others might have multiple best friends. I think that emotional intimacy in particular is used as a way for people to decide their best friends and I think that this usually devolves into a system of ranking because there is moral worth assigned to the emotional closeness you have with someone.

## Ordinal vs Categorical Classification
Thinking about our friends doesn’t have to be ordinal (ranked/ordered), but instead should be categorical (grouped). Categorizing people is non-hierarchical, but ordering friends is hierarchical. Ranking is when you order a group of things by making comparisons based on the value of certain parameters, wherein the rank means that the object in a higher rank is better than the lower rank. In order to group things you still have to look at the value of a parameter, but one category will not be seen as better than the other. It is important to think of them as groups/categories/clusters, instead as levels or tiers because that is the hierarchical thinking at work. For example, a ranking of best restaurants may take under consideration include food, service, and ambiance. I think that this kind of thinking can be detrimental to friendships, and that they should be categorized, instead of ranked. Instead you should be thinking about groups of friends like friends that I can talk to about anything, friends that I like to see every once and awhile to catch up with, friends that I like to talk about my interests with, etc.

This change from ordinal to categorical grouping may seem small and mostly semantic, and while it is on the surface, I think it will allow people to stress less about friendship and appreciate their friends more. Putting this into practice is both incredibly simple, but also very hard. All you have to do is group your friends, but then don't make comparisons between the groups, as this is what starts to form a ranking/hierarchy. Instead, you just acknowledge the differences in the type of friends that you have, but appreciate them all for what they are. Under categorical classification, it is perfectly conceivable to have multiple "best friends" where instead they would be able that you care about deeply in a similar enough amount that they would be able to grouped together.

## How should friendships be categorized?
I think that the typical parameters considered when thinking of friendships are emotional intimacy and time spent together. However I think that there are some problems with both, so I will explore the pros and cons of the views, as well as explore other alternatives. These categories are not mutually exclusive, I think that it is perfectly conceivable and probably more realistic to categorize friendships along multiple dimensions via these parameters.

### Function or Location
"This is my friend I do X with": A person who you may only talk about a few specific interests/topics with, or do certain kinds of activities, but nothing else. 

"This is my friend from X": A person who you know from a particular place which can be work, school, sport, family, etc.

I think that we often use these kinds of categorizations to downplay the relationship. The concept of "school friends" comes to mind; a person who you would see in class everyday and have friendly conversations with, but would never hang out with them outside of school. Some people would say that that's more of their acquaintance and not their "real friend", but I would absolutely argue that school friends are a type of friendship, a very important one at that.

### Emotional Closeness
Emotional closeness is an emotional connection that arises from the experience of feeling known by the other person. The main way that this happens is through reciprocal voluntary self-disclosure, but also just time spent together when these things naturally come out.

For some people, emotional closeness is absolutely the way that they categorize their relationships, but some people don’t value emotional closeness in relationships. I think it would be both insensitive but also just incorrect to dismiss these kinds of relationships and say that they are not “as deep” as other relationships. I find myself in this camp, for some of my best friends I don’t really know in-depth details about their family, childhood, etc. However, I would say that over time I generally understand their character, as well as their dreams/goals, which you could argue is emotional closeness in some sense.

### Ability to Un-Mask
I think that this is kind of related to emotional closeness, but is importantly different. Some people say that “true friendship” status is achieved when you are able to just sit around with them and do nothing, or achieve parallel play where you are both doing your own thing without talking in the same room. I think that some friendships aren’t performative per se, but you do have to put your best foot forward and put a lot of effort in trying to connect and enjoy your time with the other person. Some people call these “activity” friends, where you always have to be doing something with them, or do a specific kind of activity with them.

### Duration/Frequency of Time Spent Together
I think the categorization of friendships should solely be about frequency and duration of time spent with people. There are some people who you may want to check up with and hang out with once a quarter, once a month, once a week, or every day. I don’t think that there’s anything wrong with this, every person has something different to contribute.

One consequence of this view is that you have friends that you still care about, or have a lingering attachment to, but you don’t or can’t spend time with them anymore. The emotional closeness is probably still there; you just don’t know much of their lives anymore because you don’t see them as much. Under this view you would have to concede that without time spent together, it would not be a friendship. Maybe you could draw distinction like practicing vs non-practicing friendship in order to preserve the idea of an old friend that you don’t talk to anymore, but for some, they would be able to bite this bullet and accept the fact that that person is no longer their friend.

Another objection to this view is that you can see someone every day at school and talk to them without really being deep friends, or have a best friend that you don’t get to spend that much time with. I think that the “school” friend case is somewhat convincing, but I don’t think that the best friend case is salient because I’m sure that they would be communicating via text or calling, where we would very much count virtual time communicating as time spent together. 

### Quality of Time Spent Together
One way to get around some of the downsides of the time spent together approach would be to instead focus on the quality of the time together, or how much you enjoy spending time with that person. You don’t have to enjoy the entire time spent with your friend, but it’s more about the general feeling on the whole. In some ways I think that this takes some ideas from the "Ability to Un-Mask" parameter as well because the quality of time can be related to that.

I think that interesting potential issue with this parameter is that you can enjoy time with someone more because it is fundamentally limited, as in, the joy of spending time with that person may be amplified slightly because it doesn’t happen as often. I don't personally find this to be a problem though because there are a few friends that I really enjoy spending the time that we do together, but that I wouldn't need to or want to spend more time with them. Maybe I would want to spend more time with them if I could, but not a significant amount more, I just appreciate our time together for what it is without a need for more.

## Wrapping It All Up
I think that each person will have to end up picking a parameter or mix of parameters that speaks to them the most in order to group their friends. I am unsure if there is an objectively correct parameter in order to group your friends, I think that it ultimately comes down to what you value in your friendships. As you live and change, these parameters and how you value your friendships absolutely can and will change over time. It can be very hard to cognitively restructure your deeply held views on friendship and relationships, especially as they have been conditioned by society, but I think there is absolutely a pay-off in happiness as a result of letting go of a hierarchical view of friendship.
