I created something called "Syntax Tutor," which is a game to help students recognize incorrect syntax and write code in correct syntax.

It does this by first showing an example piece of code and asks the student is this correct syntax? Here the student can press a button to say either yes or no. If the code is incorrect, they must enter in code with the correct syntax. In this way, the student practices recognizing incorrect syntax, but also practices writing correct syntax as well.

This can be used as a way to transition between a block-based and a text-based language to facilitate typing practice. It can also be used for targeted practice to train syntax rules into a student's muscle memory.

As of right now, the proof of concept only supports JavaScript syntax, but it could be easily extended for a variety of languages.
