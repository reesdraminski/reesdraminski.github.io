Personal style is simply aesthetic preference. This can look like either catering to your own preferences or to others (i.e. the local beauty standard since there is no such thing as an universal beauty standard). I think that most fashion advice up until recent times was simply "do this and not that" which made people dress to standards other than their own.

Every person's body proportions, face, skin, hair, eyes and posture are different and are all things that will interact with whatever clothes you decide to wear. Examples of interactions:
* [Rings and Hand Size](https://blog.jamesallen.com/engagement-rings/how-to-choose-the-right-engagement-ring-for-your-hand-size/)
* [Jewelry and Skin Tone](https://thecanoshoe.com/blogs/blog/gold-or-silver-find-out-which-jewelry-tone-suits-you-better)
* [Glasses and Face Shape](https://www.eyebuydirect.com/guides/frames-and-face-shapes)

However, at the end of the day there is no way to pick how or what you want to accentuate without aesthetic preferences.

Humans generally prefer symmetry.

Individual color preferences vary greatly, but humans may prefer certain color combinations.

* People have strong preferences such as "liking certain colors and color combinations much more than others." https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~kjameson/ECST/Palmer_Schloss_ColorPreference.pdf
    * If you are looking at yourself then it makes sense to dress in colors/combinations that you like and not to other people because there is no way to please everyone.
* A lot of it is probably just pattern recognition with certain color combinations being so popular already. but why did they become popular in the first place?
I think harmonious colors with not too much clashing is good probably. Opposties are clean.

In South Korea, there is something called Personal Color Analysis (also sometimes referred to as Seasonal Color Analysis) that "that determines your most complementary color palette based on your skin tone, hair color, and eye color" ([Source](https://www.klook.com/blog/korea-color-analysis/)).

Dressing for your body means accepting your body for what it is in the moment and treating it as unchangeable. You have to meet yourself where you are and dress for how you are not how you want to be.

Its your body and you can cover up or show whatever you want to. With that being said, it is important for you to think through why you may want to cover/show certain parts.

Fit is everything so a well-designed garment will fit your body correctly. However clothes are not designed this way usually so sometimes you will not be able to wear the same items as other people.

I don't think that just because you are *X* or have *Y* that it means that you automatically can never wear *Z*. I prefer to think of it as you can wear anything, but some things will work better on your than others, and that's totally okay. You wouldn't say that gold or silver jewelry is somehow superior to the other, its just that usually [one suits you better than the other](https://thecanoshoe.com/blogs/blog/gold-or-silver-find-out-which-jewelry-tone-suits-you-better).

Skinny Jeans for example who it look good on?

Face shape and glasses
Silver and gold jewelry and skin tone

What is personal style?
* Is it better to dress in what makes you happy or to express yourself?
    * Expressing yourself can make you feel happy because you are not stifled and feel in tune with yourself.
    * Expressing yourself doesn't make you confident, usually confidence is what allows you to express yourself.
* Is no style a style?
    * It depends. You can intentionally not care about style and dress in whatever in order to make a statement about fashion. This means that it is a style.
    * However there are also people who legitimately only dress for cost and comfort so that it something that informs their clothing choices but I won't say it is a style.
    * You can dress for comfort in almost any aesthetic.

Personal style is unique but I think that just relying on aesthetics or combination of aesthetics doesn't get us to uniqueness. I think that it is the interplay with your interest with what you want to express, it does not have to be related to your self! You can just want to project a certain image and that's fine. Maybe you become the image later but I don't think that means that you were somehow inauthentic to yourself beforehand because I don't think that there was any expectation of aesthetic and personality to match up.

I think we have capitalism has induced a lens of marketing within us so a lot of definitions of personal style lean on the idea that it is our personal brand. A lot of people would say that personal style is just the aesthetic that you exhibit through the clothes that you wear.

Traditional style advice doesn't always apply, but usually there are reasons for it.
