## Background
When I moved into my first place after college, I bought [a bar cart](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XYNJCPV). I was influenced by TikTok and I wanted a place to store all my liquor that I had accumulated throughout my time in college. I really liked this bar cart, and it served me well, but I eventually outgrew it and started looking for other storage/display solutions. I recently have started to de-center alcohol in my life, which isn't to say that it was centered before, but I think that after some reflection, I was surprised my how many social situations involved drinking. I never really enjoyed drinking hard liquor, but I do love craft beer. So, although I myself don't drink the liquor I have on hand, it comes in handy when I am hosting.

_What my bar cart/beverage area looked like_

## Criteria
Since I didn't want alcohol to have such a large presence in my life, I wanted to less prominently display the bottles. However, at the same time, I didn't want the bottles to not be completely hidden, which is why I shied away from a more traditional bar/liquor cabinet. Liquor bottle and label design is so cool and I really like the visual diversity that it brings, so I still wanted to be able to see the products.

Additionally, I wanted a work surface that I could have as a coffee bar, but eventually add a kettle for tea and other things as well. I already had a coffee nook of sorts  in my kitchen, but I wanted to see if I could co-locate all my beverage related things together because the bar cart was already next to the beverage fridge and table top ice machine.

I already had the bar cart next to my beverage fridge against a wall in my dining room, so I knew that it had to fit in that space. I wanted it to be around 33 inches in height because my [mini fridge](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LY66PG4) is that height and I thought that it would be nice if they were about the same size.

In this way, I'm calling the space a "beverage bar" instead of a coffee bar or a liquor shelf because it caters to all kinds of different beverages, and it also includes the fridge along with it.

## Solutioning
My search began with two-tier bookshelves, because a nice closed back shelf would be able to be solid and hold appliances on top and liquor well. However, it was hard to find one in the dimensions I wanted that also could house the liquor bottle. I wanted about 13‚Äù between shelves as that was the height of my tallest bottle, but that was a bit on the smaller side from [what I saw elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/vgum5n/bottle_height_for_liquor_cabinet).

Then I was looking into (industrial) shelving because thats what I used at my old house with my roommates for a pantry, and I liked the chrome steel kind of look. However, it was extremely difficult to find a more industrial shelf that was deep enough, so I eventually gave up.

Then I went back to where I kind of started and looked into beverage carts because I thought they would at least be a bit more agnostic than a bar cart. To their credit, they are, but I wanted to get away from carts because I didn't actually need it to move, so it was annoying when people would walk by it and I could hear it move. 

My search into beverage carts lead me into mobile kitchen islands, where were very lovely and interested me at first.

However, the islands had more closed storage with cabinetry or not large enough shelf space, which led into searching specifically for mobile kitchen islands with "open shelving". I kind of found what I was looking for, but I still wanted to get away from wheels.

And then, after about an hour of searching, I found it. A [baker's rack](https://www.wayfair.com/sca/ideas-and-advice/guides/what-is-a-bakers-rack-do-you-need-one-T21409). I had never heard of it before, but I knew immediately that it was what I wanted.

_The Baker's rack that I ended up purchasing_

This is [the one that I settled on](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VLY8SR5), and basically one of the first baker's racks that I saw. It had everything that I wanted, a nice work surface with good length and depth, as well as shelves with enough clearance to store liquor bottles. It was also similar height to my beverage fridge, so it was going to integrate perfectly. It even had the rings to hang mugs at the top, which I absolutely love. I never knew about it before, but now I am going to keep that feature with me for as long as I live. I have some buyer's remorse over the fact that I wish it were a bit longer, but I just have to be more mindful and efficient with the space provided.

_My beverage bar all set up_

One of my favorite touches in my beverage bar is the bowl of Sweet & Low. Something about the unnatural florescent pink is so nostalgic from my time in local diners, and it also is a good sugar-free sweetener. In the future, I'm thinking of weaving some fairy lights into the wire grate on the upper part of the shelf, as well as wrapping some ivy around the top part of the shelf near where the mugs are hanging.
