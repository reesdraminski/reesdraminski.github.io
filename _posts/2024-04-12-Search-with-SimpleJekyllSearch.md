## Background

About a month ago I knew that I wanted to add search functionality to my Digital Garden somehow. In researching, I found Gaurav Trivedi's [article about implementing Simple Jekyll Search](https://beingtechnicalwriter.com/jekyllsearch/) which first put me on to Christian Fei's [SimpleJekyllSearch JavaScript library](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search). It was exactly what I was looking for, but it didn't have everything that I needed. I don't really remember how but I was able to find Jake Lee's article about [how he was using SimpleJekyllSearch](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/using-simplejekyllsearch-for-easy-and-quick-site-search/) which really tied it all together for me because it provided a great foundation for using the templating and sorting middleware.

## My Implementation

I use Jake's set up of the templating and sorting middleware, and only made minor changes except for one large one to the templating. The minor changes included modifying the classes to fit within Bootstrap's and my own naming conventions, switching the search input from type="text" to type="search", adding a debounce time, and changing `searchResultTemplate` to be a multi-line template string for easier reading.

The larger templating change was because I knew that I didn't want to show the Jekyll excerpt of the post like he was doing, but rather an excerpt of the content surrounding the matched search term. Excerpts are potentially good at providing context for the article itself, but I wanted to instead focus of the context of the occurence of the search term within the post to better help searchers.

My excerpt algorithm is roughly as follows:
1. Find first occurrence
2. Find the start of substring
    1. Start with 120 characters before first occurrence
    2. If substring start is not content start and we are not after a space, backtrack until whole word shows
3. Find the end of substring
    1. Start with 120 characters after the first occurrence
    2. If substring end is not content end and we are not before a space, go forward until whole word shows

The word cut-off prevention algorithm is maybe not as elegant as I think it could be, but it will never loop that much so I'm not super worried about performance costs.
```js
// .toLowerCase() both streings makes indexOf case-insensitive
const firstOccurrence = value.toLowerCase().indexOf(
    document.getElementById("searchInput").value.toLowerCase()
);

// 120 chars is roughly 1-2 sentences
let start = firstOccurrence - 120;

// cannot have negative start for substring
if (start < 0)
{
    start = 0;
}
// if non-beginning start, backtrack until whole word shows
else
{
    // go until we hit the beginning of content or a word spacing
    while (start > 0 && value[start - 1] != " ")
    {
        start--;
    }
}
```

A few notes about my implementation:
* SimpleJekyllSearch's search is case-insensitive by default (don't quote me if I'm wrong though), so I had to make the first occurrence searching case-insensitive as well.
* indexOf() just grabs the first occurrence of the search term but thatâ€™s fine with me. It would be interesting to try to show all instances of the search term, but I don't see much utility in that for my website.
* I wanted to inline the JSON that SimpleJekyllSearch uses to search, but it made the document pretty heavy because of full text of articles was > 1MB. I decided to just accept the network request approach because search is not worth longer page load. I would rather only the search functionality be delayed rather than the entire page.
* The word cut-off prevention algorithm checks for a space because that is a word boundary, but it means that it will catch punctuation. This isn't the end of the world, but can look ugly next the the ellipses.
* I didn't show the forward tracking algorithm for finding the `end` of the substring, but that is just the `start` algorithm but reversed

## Potential Future Improvements

Just like Jake notes in his article, I wish I could figure out a way to only match full instances of the search term. I understand the utility of partial matching but it leads to some unintuitive search results most times. I think I could use the sortMiddleware to calculate the "fullness" of the match to try to at the very least relegate partial matches to lower in the search rankings.

My Digital Garden is relatively small now, but as it grows I do worry about how long the search results may get. This would be a great use case for pagination of the search results, but I'm not sure how involved it would be for the actual utility. Bootstrap has a pagination component that would work for the occasion, but I would still have to figure out the JavaScript for it.
