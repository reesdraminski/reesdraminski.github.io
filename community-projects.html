                I have designed and implemented a great deal of projects, both for myself and the organizations that I have been a part of. Something that I think is really great about programming is how code can be re-used, and how projects can lead into other greater projects. In this way, I tried to capture the process of me developing these projects for the organizations I've been a part of.

                        TeCanal was a student-run 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that aimed at providing STEM education and technology resources to underserved areas in Baltimore City. I served as the CTO, CEO, and Director of Technology before the organization was dissolved.

                                In October 2016, as my first foray into making educational games, I created SpeedyMath, an customizable math problem game. It started out with only the "Race" mode, where you had to answer as many questions you could in one minute. However, then I added "Practice" mode (later called "Infinity" mode) where there was no time limit, so that students could do math without the pressures of a time limit, more akin to doing a worksheet.

                                About a month after first developing Speedy Math, I wanted to create an engaging math game that did not rely on time pressure, as that could stress some students out, making them answer incorrectly. Thus, Math Slayer was born, where each correct answer inflicts damage to the monster character, and an incorrect answer causes damage to the player, until their HP runs out. It started out as its own program, but later on got folded into the Speedy Math umbrella as "Survival" mode.

                                In late 2016, following from success of using Speedy Math at TeCanal STEM tutoring sessions, I knew I also wanted to create some kind of typing game. The computer we were using were low-powered and also there was no internet connection at the centers we were tutoring for, so making our own typing game that could run off an HTML and JS local file seemed like the logical move.

                            </h5>

                            <p>
                                Speedy Math and Type Shooter were great games with educational value, but they didn't really teach anything, they only allowed for practice of already learned concepts. For this reason, I created Binary Explorer, a way for students to learn about Binary, especially its connection with ASCII. This game was later improved upon by a TeCanal Intern to add a "Story" mode.

                                In March 2017, I discovered Mozilla's X-Ray goggles project, as well as some of their other development activities. This made me recreate one of the lessons about meme-making with a live-reload editor built with CodeMirror. Building on the success of Meme Maker, I made Webcomic Creator shortly after, loosely inspired by Comic Life. This was used in our Creative Coding summer camp that we ran with Creative Alliance.

                                In April 2018, in an effort to consolidate STEM education resources, I created the TeCanal Kid's Corner. It pulled together all the games I worked on previously, and also added a Free STEM Library. This was a collection of Creative Commons or Public Domain STEM books that I found and had download links for students and their families to use. In the Summer of 2020, we had a Software Engineering Intern program that was able to add new features to my old games, as well as add brand new ones.

                                In July 2019, I began the year-long development of a JavaScript learning tool. My aim was to decouple JavaScript from HTML/CSS, and instead allow the user to have a environment to receive instantaneous visual feedback while being able to be creative while focusing on JavaScript syntax and concepts. To date this is the TeCanal project that I am most proud of.

Syntax Tutor was the first program in a series of projects that I wrote with the intent to help students practice or learn Computer Science, particularly JavaScript. Syntax Tutor works by showing examples of correct or incorrect syntax examples in order to improve students recognition of syntax errors.

Parson's Puzzles are about rearranging code blocks to produce the correct result, and Program2Play is where the student has to implement a small part of a game in order to play it, thus providing a goal-oriented programming learning environment. In my case, they are rearranging code blocks with Mosaic code in order to complete a feature within a larger game, and then be able to play it.

Unlimited Trace Tutor: Learning Code Tracing With Automatically Generated Programs. I thought it was a really great idea, as this comes up in AP Computer Science a lot, but also is an important skill to have. Unlimited Trace Tutor was only implemented in Java, so I wanted to make a version for JavaScript that also ran on the web. Trace Tutor and Syntax Tutor share a lot of the same UI components and functionality, so it was a pretty straightforward project to implement.

I knew that UMBC employees were state employees since we are a public university, so after some quick googling, I found the <a href="https://salaries.news.baltimoresun.com/">Baltimore Sun's dataset</a>. After cleaning the CSV, I used PapaParse on the frontend to convert it into a JavaScript object to make it easier to work with after fetching.

                                Excited about the seed of the idea of creating applications for UMBC students to use planted by Salary Search, I turned my focus to information centralization and visualization. I found it quite hard to keep track of all of the opening and closing times for all of the various buildings and stores on campus, especially since weekend hours were different. I made this app to show which places were Open Now, Closing Soon, and Closed, as well as displayed the hours. Later on, I also added a section that displayed what the current meal period was. I eventually stopped development on the app because similar functionality was going to be added to our campus web portal, myUMBC.

I had used the UMBC Transit system, which is free to all UMBC students, a few times to go into Catonsville and Arbutus, so I thought that was a natural point for providing students with things to do. The Activity Guide was a specific activity that a person could do if they got off at a certain transit stop. I initially wanted to allow users to submit their own, but I eventually decided against it.

                                Nap Map was an application that was inspired by a poster of the same name that I saw posted around campus by the Office of Health Promotions. I wasn't familiar with mapping libraries when I made the app, so I used a high-res screenshot of the campus map instead, and create a &lt;map&gt; element to allow clicking to view locations. Similarly to TAG, I initially wanted to allow users to submit their own, but I eventually decided against it. I stopped development on this project to get folded into a larger mapping application called Grit Map.

                                UMBC provided handheld barcode laser scanning to scan UMBC IDs for event attendance, but they had a limited amount, which often created bottlenecks at larger events. I used the Quagga barcode scanning API that worked on HTML5 Camera streams, and used the Google Sheets API to automatically record scanned barcodes. It probably would've been better to do server-side barcode analysis, but I didn't/do't have the infrastructure for that. I stopped development on this project because it was kind of impractical to do this on mobile devices, and myUMBC was potentially planning on implementing a QR code for students that would allow for a much better scanning experience.

                                The next app that I made during my Freshman year was a meal plan analysis tool. I figured out that you could download the data of your meal plan swipes as a CSV, so using the lessons I learned with PapaParse from Salary Search, I was easily able to get the data into a usable state, to which I used D3 to visualize the data.

I got pretty far in the Node.js version, before I learned that the UMBC infrastructure only allowed for LAMP stack applications. I didn't want to rewrite my work, so instead I just focused on the menu viewing functionality, as the DineOnCampus website was super slow.

All of this was in the interest of empowering student developers with web-friendly, well-documented APIs to use to get data related to the UMBC student experience (Dining, Transit, Laundry, etc).

I knew about the UMBC Police public incident reports, and I tried to parse it, but I couldn't pull it off. Then I found pdf.js-extract which allows parsing of PDF documents without OCR, and then creating the parser was smooth sailing from there. Then I was able to plot the points on the UMBC Campus MapBox map that was created by the UMBC Sys Admin/Software Development club.

                                Since UMBC doesn't use the +/- system, I always found online college GPA calculators to be quite annoying, so I set out to create my own. That was easy enough, but then I wanted a way to quickly calculate cumulative GPA which was hard, because I needed a way to import a lot of class data. Then the SGA President suggested the Unofficial Transcript, which was perfect because I just adapted pdf.js-extract for the web, and created a parser for the transcript document. Transcript Analyzer has a slightly more advanced parser, and shows more information as well as lets the user search and sort through their data.

                    hackUMBC is UMBC's hackathon and hackathon organizing student organization. hackUMBC is 24-hour tech innovation marathon where students across the East Coast collaborate to develop ideas to build mobile, web, and hardware projects. HackUMBC invites diverse groups of students to enjoy a weekend of programming, workshops, tech talks, networking, and other fun activities. At the end of 24 hours, participants' projects are presented and judged for different prize categories from sponsors and other organizations.

                            This first project wasn't officially for hackUMBC, but I actually did it at the hackUMBC Spring 2018 hackathon before I was officially enrolled as a UMBC student. I won third place for this project, but also was able to get a spot on the hackUMBC Tech Team to be able to implement something similar. I ended up integrating the QR check-in concept into <a href="https://github.com/umbchackers/quill">Quill</a>, an open-source hackathon registration system initially developed by hackMIT. I still stand by the original vision of Hack Check, that being the social media part, but COVID-19 thwarted my development and rollout schedule.

                            I was watching some competitive programming videos on YouTube as well as practicing Leetcode/Hackerrank problems in order to get prepared for interviews, when I had an idea. What if you couldn't use backspace? Instead you had to start from scratch every time you made a mistake? That's how this idea was born, and it eventually morphed into a platform in which people could self-host it to make it a game. This game idea was perfect for hackUMBC so I brought it under the Tech Team and assigned it to a member to flesh out the architecture more. It went very smoothly, but COVID-19 prevented us from actually trying it since I did not want the first launch to be virtual and try to debug it while people were trying it from all over the world.

                            One thing that I always noticed at hackUMBC and hackathons in general is that most times people talk to new people at the beginning when they're looking for teams, and maybe new people if they go to a workshop or some event. I wanted to make an application to allow people to plan "meetups" that will allow you to congregate with people who share a commonality in order to forge friendships that last far beyond a hackathon. As is a common theme with my hackUMBC projects, this project was never officially launched because we had a virtual hackathon. This would have translated fairly well to online, I think, but I didn't want the first launch to be virtual.
